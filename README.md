📌 Features

Public dataset: Telco Customer Churn (Kaggle)

Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

Machine Learning models: Logistic Regression and Decision Tree

Model evaluation using accuracy (~80–81%)

Feature importance analysis to identify churn drivers

Business recommendations for customer retention
