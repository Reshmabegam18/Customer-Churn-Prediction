ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn (whether a customer will leave or stay) in a subscription-based business using the Telco Customer Churn dataset.

The goal is to help businesses:

Identify customers at risk of leaving.

Understand churn drivers like tenure, billing, and contract type.

Develop strategies to improve customer retention.

ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree

IDE: Jupyter Notebook

ðŸ”„ Workflow

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing â€“ removed null values, encoded categorical variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ visualized churn patterns across contracts, tenure, and charges.

Model Building â€“ trained Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models.

Evaluation â€“ achieved ~80â€“81% accuracy.

Feature Importance â€“ identified high-risk churn drivers.

ðŸ”‘ Key Insights

Customers with month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn.

New users (short tenure) tend to leave faster.

High monthly charges increase churn probability.

ðŸ’¡ Business Recommendations

Offer discounts to new or high-bill customers.

Promote long-term contracts to reduce churn risk.

Provide value-added services (e.g., tech support, online security) to boost retention.
